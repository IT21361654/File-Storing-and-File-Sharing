1. Introduction

1.1 Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, the widespread use of mobile devices has introduced new challenges in ensuring cybersecurity, particularly concerning smishing (SMS phishing) attacks. These deceptive campaigns aim to manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information through text messages, posing a significant threat to personal privacy and financial security. Smishing attacks often exploit the immediacy and trust associated with SMS communication, making them difficult to detect and mitigate effectively. [1]

The challenge lies in identifying and preventing smishing attacks in real-time, especially considering the diverse languages and cultural contexts in which these messages may be crafted. Traditional approaches to phishing detection, which primarily focus on email communication, may not be suitable for detecting smishing attempts via SMS, as they often lack metadata and exhibit different linguistic patterns. [2]

 2.1 Architectural Design

The architectural design of SMS Guardian is based on a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for flexibility, extensibility, and performance optimization. The system architecture comprises several key components:

- Message Analysis Module: This component is responsible for analyzing incoming messages to identify suspicious content indicative of smishing attempts. It employs language detection algorithms, keyword-based analysis, and pattern recognition techniques to classify messages as either normal or suspicious based on predefined criteria.
 

- User Interface Module: The user interface module provides a seamless and intuitive platform for users to interact with the SMS Guardian system. It includes features such as message alert notifications, message history tracking, and configuration settings for customizing alert preferences.

- Database Management Module: This module handles the storage and retrieval of message data, user profiles, and system configurations. It utilizes a relational database management system (RDBMS) to ensure data integrity, consistency, and scalability.
 
- Alerting System Module: The alerting system module is responsible for notifying users in real-time upon detection of a suspicious message. It employs various communication channels, including SMS, email, and push notifications, to deliver timely alerts and advisories.

The architectural design follows the principles of modularity, encapsulation, and separation of concerns to promote maintainability, reusability, and scalability. Each component is designed to fulfill a specific set of functionalities while remaining loosely coupled with other components, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment.


2.2 Data Flow and Interaction

The interaction between different components of SMS Guardian is facilitated through well-defined interfaces and protocols. The following sequence diagram illustrates the data flow and interaction between the message analysis module, user interface module, database management module, and alerting system module:

user Message Analysis Module
user User Interface Module
user Database Management Module
User -> Message Analysis Module: Send incoming message
Message Analysis Module -> Message Analysis Module: Perform language detection\nand keyword-based analysis
alt Message classified as suspicious
    Message Analysis Module -> Alerting System Module: Trigger alert event
    User Interface Module -> User: Display alert notification
else Message classified as normal
    Message Analysis Module -> Database Management Module: Store message data

1. The message analysis module receives incoming messages from external sources, such as SMS gateways or mobile network providers.
2. The message analysis module performs language detection and keyword-based analysis to classify messages as normal or suspicious.
3. If a message is classified as suspicious, the message analysis module triggers an alerting event and sends relevant information to the alerting system module.
4. The alerting system module generates and delivers alerts to users via SMS, email, or push notifications, based on their configured preferences.
5. Users receive alerts and can take appropriate actions, such as blocking the sender or reporting the message as spam. (Not implemented)
6. The user interface module updates the message history and displays relevant information to the user, including alert notifications and message details.

The data flow follows a structured and orchestrated process, ensuring seamless communication and coordination between different system components. By decoupling message analysis, alerting, and user interaction functionalities, SMS Guardian achieves flexibility and scalability in handling incoming message traffic and responding to potential smishing attacks effectively.

2.3 Database Design

The database design of SMS Guardian is essential for storing and managing message data, user profiles, and system configurations. The database schema is designed to ensure data integrity, consistency, and scalability, accommodating the growing volume of incoming messages and user interactions.

 3. Evaluation

3.1 Assessment of the Project Results

The project has been a valuable learning experience, albeit with some limitations in achieving its full potential. The primary technique used for data analysis was based on identifying suspicious messages through keyword detection, particularly focusing on languages such as Tamil and Sinhala. While this approach showed promise in detecting certain types of smishing attempts, it was not as robust or accurate as originally anticipated.

One of the main challenges encountered was the limited scope of the analysis technique, which relied solely on keyword matching without incorporating more advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. This led to instances where legitimate messages were incorrectly flagged as suspicious, highlighting the need for more sophisticated analysis methods.

Furthermore, the project faced constraints in terms of time and resources, resulting in a simplified implementation compared to the initial project vision. As a result, certain objectives, such as real-time analysis and automated detection, were not fully realized.

Moving forward, there are several areas for improvement and refinement:

Enhanced Data Analysis: Incorporating more advanced NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis and context-aware parsing, to improve the accuracy and reliability of message classification.

Integration of Machine Learning: Implementing machine learning models to dynamically adapt and refine the detection criteria based on evolving patterns and trends in smishing attacks.

User Feedback Mechanism: Introducing a feedback mechanism for users to report false positives and provide feedback on message analysis accuracy, facilitating continuous improvement and refinement.

Expanded Language Support: Extending language support beyond Tamil and Sinhala to encompass a broader range of languages commonly used in the target user base.
